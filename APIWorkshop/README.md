## Instructions

### Task #1

Our first task for you to get familiar with jQuery is animating a circle. The circle is already created for you, the challenge will be to change its width so that it grows in size and then shrinks to its original shape when you click on it.

You will be writing your code in the `changeBackground()` function.

Some suggestions on how to start:
- look at jQuery `animate()` documentation: https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/eff_animate.asp
- consider using `if` and `else` (conditional) statements in your code. You can look at documentation that will explain these concepts: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp. Or as an available mentor.
- consider using a variable/s: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp


### Task #2


### Task #3

Our third task requires us to work with GIPHY API. An API stands for Application programming interface. API's are used as tools for developers to build applications/websites.

We will be exploring GIPHY API:
https://developers.giphy.com/docs/

To use GIPHY API, we will be needing something called an API Key which will grant us access to use GIPHY API. Click on `Create an App` to create a GIPHY account and get an API key. To view you API key, go to: https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/.

We will be using the Random Endpoint for GIPHY found in the docs: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/. What we will be doing is sending a request to `api.giphy.com` for a GIF. We will be doing this using AJAX: https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax_get_post.asp.

AJAX will allow us to exchange data with `api.giphy.com` and update our website without reloading. jQuery gives us methods that will make it easier for us to write our AJAX method. We will be sending a `GET` request to GIPHY. `GET` requests are used to retrieve data from a url.

The tricky part is figuring out the url we should send our request to. We can look at GIPHYDevelopers documentation for some help.

(Be sure to write your code in the `searchGiphy()` function.)
